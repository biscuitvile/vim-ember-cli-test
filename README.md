# Vim-Ember-CLI-Test

Vim Ember-CLI Test is a small plugin that makes opening running tests in
the browser more convenient from vim.

## Mappings

`<leader>q` Will open the nearest named test in the browser

`<leader>Q` Will run all the tests in the browser

## Credit

Big hat tip to  @vicramon and @jgdavey. Their work on similar plugins informed
my vimscript tremendously.

## To-do

  * Specify the port or address that your tests are running at
  * Add an option to run tests on the command line
